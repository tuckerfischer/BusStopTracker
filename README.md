# BusStopTracker

The Purpose of this project was to create an animation that would follow the bus stops leading up to MIT. 

## Get Started

Download all of the files and open index.html file to view the progression of the bus!

## Future improvements

I would like to connect this to an API in order to visualize multiple buses in different cities.
